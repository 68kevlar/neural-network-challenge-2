Introduction to Preprocessing

It introduces preprocessing as the first step in the workflow.
Code: Importing Dependencies

Libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and TensorFlow are imported.
The dataset is loaded from a URL into a DataFrame, and the first few rows are displayed.
Code: Exploring Data

The number of unique values in each column is determined to understand data variety.
Code: Creating Target Variable (y_df)

A DataFrame for the target variable is created, specifically focusing on "Attrition" and "Department" columns.
Code: Selecting Features for Predictors (X_df)

At least 10 features such as "Age," "HourlyRate," and "YearsAtCompany" are selected for building the predictor dataset. Data types for these features are examined.
